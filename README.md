# image-ai-upscaler

Image AI Upscaler is a simple Python CLI program which upscales images with JPG and PNG extensions using your GPU (or CPU if no CUDA GPU is available). Currently it has a hardcoded x4 upscale algorithm. \
\
Before you run the program:

- create **_images_** and **_results_** folders inside of the main directory;
- put your images inside of **_images_** folder;
- run main.py file.

Your upscaled images are going to be located inside of the **_results_** folder.

## To do:

- make it possible to choose between x2, x4 and x8 upscale multiplier.
